## About me
  I’m 27 years old pathologist who’s looking for career in software engineering sphere. I have started my path with QA course, where I’ve  learnt about computer science basics, git, client-server architecture. But after QA course I understood that creating process is encourage me much more than testing. Incredibly motivated to learn new and become Web-developer.
